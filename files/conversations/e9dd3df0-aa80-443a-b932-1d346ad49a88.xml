    <content>To create a simple example of using LlamaIndex (formerly known as GPT Index) for loading a document into an in-memory Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, you'll need to perform several steps. This involves setting up your environment, loading the document, and then querying it.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary packages. You can do this using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install llama-index
   ```

2. **Create a Python Script:**
   Below is a simple script that demonstrates how to use LlamaIndex to load a document into an in-memory RAG system.

   ```python
   from llama_index import SimpleIndex

   # Create a simple index
   index = SimpleIndex()

   # Load your document
   document_text = """
   LlamaIndex is a powerful tool for building and utilizing an index over your documents.
   It allows for efficient querying and retrieval of information.
   """

   # Add the document to the index
   index.add_document(document_text)

   # Query the index
   query = "What is LlamaIndex?"
   results = index.query(query)

   # Display results
   print("Query Results:")
   for result in results:
       print(result)
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   Save the script to a file, for example, `simple_rag_example.py`, and run it using:

   ```bash
   python simple_rag_example.py
   ```

4. **Understand the Output:**
   The script creates a simple in-memory index of a given document and then allows you to query the index. The results will be printed out, showing the parts of the document that are relevant to your query.

This example uses a hypothetical `SimpleIndex` class from `llama-index`. Make sure to refer to the actual documentation or codebase for `llama-index` to understand the exact classes and methods available, as APIs might change over time or might need additional configuration.</content>
